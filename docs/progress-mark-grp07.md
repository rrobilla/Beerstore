### Wk. 3:
* Gantt looks good. Please move it into the docs sub-folder.
* Commit msgs are good.
* Several commits being made directly on master. You should be making branches and merging them in.
* Use Issue Tracker for ideas, bugs, discussions, assigning work.

### Wk. 4:
* Gantt wasn't updated.
* Commit msgs. are good.
* Branching and Merging looks much better. Branch names need improvement. Instead of MattBranch, call it matt-fixing-buttons-index-page.

* Commit msgs. are good.
* Branch names still need improvement, otherwise good.
